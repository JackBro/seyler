Welcome to the Corelan GIT project page for mona.py development.
GIT will only be used for active development, not for releases or updates from within Immunity Debugger.

If you are interested in contributing to mona.py, please

- create a fork of this project
- clone your fork to your development machine.  
   I am using tortoiseGit on my windows machine, which works fine.  
   Don't forget to create a public/private keypair & configure your git page to accept your public key
- implement your changes. Pay attention to coding styles (tab indentation, etc)
- submit your changes as a pull request
