Rootkit uses the zero day vulnerability in win32k.sys (buffer overflow in function win32k!bInitializeEUDC()) to get the execution at the OS startup.
 
Features:
 
 * NDIS-based network backdoor (+ meterpreter/bind_tcp).
  
 * In order to avoid unknown executable code detection it moves itself in the memory over discardable sections of some default Windows drivers.
    
 * Completely undetectable by public anti-rootkit tools.
  
 * Working on Windows 7 (SP0, SP1) x86.

This rootkit was originally presented at the ZeroNights 2012 conference during my talk.
